# ChatApp
A basic chat application using express, sockets and react.

Plan on expanding this project further.


# Get Started:

First pull files and do a "npm i" in both client and server folders.


Then open a terminal in each folder directory, typing "npm run start" in BOTH.


Enjoy the super simple chat application.
